As a Software Engineer at Infomaniak, I've contributed to the development of the official Terraform provider for Infomaniak's cloud services. This provider allows users to manage Infomaniak resources through HashiCorp's Terraform infrastructure as code tool.

## Features

- Manage Infomaniak Cloud resources with Terraform
- Support for Kubernetes clusters, storage, and network resources
- Full integration with Terraform workflows
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Technologies Used

- Go
- Terraform Plugin SDK
- OpenAPI
- Infomaniak Cloud API

This project demonstrates my expertise in infrastructure as code, API design, and cloud resource management. The provider is maintained as part of my work at Infomaniak, supporting the company's commitment to providing modern developer tools for cloud infrastructure management.
