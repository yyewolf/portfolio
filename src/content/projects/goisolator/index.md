GoIsolator is a lightweight tool I developed to provide container isolation capabilities. It offers a simple but effective approach to isolate containerized applications for improved security and resource management.

## Features

- Container isolation through namespace separation
- Resource limiting capabilities
- Small footprint and minimal dependencies
- Simple API for integration into existing systems

## Technologies Used

- Go
- Linux namespaces
- Container runtime technologies
- System-level security mechanisms

This project showcases my understanding of container isolation principles and system-level programming in Go. GoIsolator serves as a practical utility for scenarios where you need container-like isolation without the overhead of a full container runtime.
