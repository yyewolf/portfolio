Golte is an innovative bridge application I built that connects SMS messaging with Discord. This "cursed" project (as I playfully call it) demonstrates my ability to integrate disparate systems and protocols to create unique communication solutions.

## Features

- Bidirectional communication between SMS and Discord
- Message formatting and conversion
- Support for various SMS gateways
- Discord bot integration

## Technologies Used

- Go for the core application
- Discord API integration
- SMS gateway integrations
- Message queue handling

This project showcases my interest in connecting different communication platforms and my ability to work with various APIs and protocols. Golte solves the unique challenge of bridging traditional SMS communication with modern chat platforms like Discord.
