GoCD is a lightweight continuous deployment utility I created specifically for Docker environments. It provides a streamlined approach to handling container deployments without the complexity of larger CD systems.

## Features

- Fast container deployment and updates
- Configuration through simple YAML files
- Webhook integration for automated deployments
- Minimal resource requirements

## Technologies Used

- Go
- Docker API
- Webhooks
- YAML for configuration

This project demonstrates my approach to solving deployment challenges with a lightweight, purpose-built tool rather than relying on complex, resource-intensive solutions. GoCD focuses on doing one thing well: managing Docker-based deployments efficiently.
