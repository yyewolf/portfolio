go-ipxl is a Go library designed for controlling iPixel LED displays over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It simplifies the process of sending images, text, and commands to the display, making it easier for developers to integrate LED matrix functionality into their applications.

## Features

- Fast and efficient communication with iPixel displays
- Support for sending images, text, and animations
- Easy-to-use API for developers

## Technologies Used

- Go
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- Protocol Buffers for data serialization
