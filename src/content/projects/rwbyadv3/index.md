RWBY Adventures 3 is a passion project I've developed that showcases my ability to create complex backend systems for interactive applications. Based on the RWBY universe, this project demonstrates my skills in creating scalable game backends and distributed systems.

## Features

- Distributed backend architecture
- Real-time game mechanics
- User authentication and profiles
- Data persistence and state management

## Technologies Used

- Go for the main backend services
- TypeScript for dungeons implementation
- Microservices architecture
- Database integrations

This project represents my passion for creating complex systems that can handle real-time interactions while maintaining performance and reliability. The codebase showcases my approach to structuring large applications with clean separation of concerns.
