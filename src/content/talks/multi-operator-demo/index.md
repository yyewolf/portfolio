In this talk at Silicon Chalet, I demonstrated how to combine multiple Kubernetes operators to create a comprehensive solution. The presentation covered:

- Principles of Kubernetes operators and their role in automating application management
- How to coordinate multiple operators in a single environment
- Practical examples of operator interactions and dependencies
- Best practices for scaling operator-managed applications

The demonstration showcased real-world scenarios where operators simplify complex Kubernetes deployments while maintaining reliability and scalability.
